Hi, I'm Rama 👋  

I build **data-driven systems** that combine **Data Engineering foundations** with **Data Science and Generative AI** to turn messy data into reliable decisions and scalable products.

My work spans the **full lifecycle of data systems** — from ingestion and modeling, to analysis, machine learning, and GenAI applications such as RAG and agents.

---

### 🚀 What I build
- End-to-end **data engineering pipelines** (batch & streaming)
- **Data science workflows**: analysis, feature engineering, and modeling
- **Generative AI applications** (RAG systems, agent-based prototypes)
- ML- and GenAI-ready datasets with a focus on reliability and evaluation

---

### 🧠 Current focus (2025)
- Designing analytics- and ML-ready **data models**
- Building **RAG pipelines** with evaluation and failure analysis
- Feature engineering and data quality for ML systems
- Converting ideas into production-oriented data & AI solutions

### 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, SQL  
**Data Engineering:** Spark (PySpark), ETL / ELT, Data Modeling, Data Warehousing  
**Data Science & ML:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Statistics, Model Evaluation  
**Generative AI:** RAG pipelines, agent workflows  
**Cloud & Tools:** AWS (S3, Redshift), Git  
**Analytics:** Power BI (consumption layer)
