Hi, I'm Rama 👋  

I build data-driven systems and AI-powered prototypes that turn messy data into reliable decisions and scalable products.

I focus on the **engineering side of ML** — from problem framing → data → experimentation → deployment-ready outcomes.

---

### 🚀 What I build
- End-to-end **data analysis and ML pipelines**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and agent-based prototypes
- Feature engineering workflows that improve model reliability
- Early-stage AI product prototypes with measurable outcomes

---

### 🧠 Current focus (2025)
- Translating business problems into ML formulations
- Building RAG systems with evaluation & failure analysis
- Model monitoring, data quality, and system robustness
- Reading research papers and converting ideas into working code

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
**Data & ML:** NumPy, Pandas, Power BI, Pyspark, Scikit-learn, PyTorch  
**Practices:** Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Data Analysis, Data Warehousing  
**Concepts:** Statistics, ML fundamentals, system design for ML, scalable pipelines
